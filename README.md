# My-Calcii
Check out my GitHub repo! I've created a fully functional web calculator using HTML, CSS, and JS. It demonstrates my front-end skills with an intuitive UI and performs complex arithmetic operations. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and use it as a foundation for your projects.
